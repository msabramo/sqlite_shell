This project contains a ton of code lifted from APSW
(https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw/) by Roger Binns. Specifically, I have used
code from APSW's
[tools/shell.py](https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw/blob/master/tools/shell.py).

APSW is Copyright (c) 2004-2015 Roger Binns <rogerb@rogerbinns.com>

I have borrowed code from APSW, but I have also modified said code, so be aware
that this is NOT APSW and I am NOT the original author of much of this code.
