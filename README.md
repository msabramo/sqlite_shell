# sqlite_shell

A friendlier [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/) shell

Borrows from the [shell from
APSW](https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw/blob/master/tools/shell.py) but
makes it work with Python's built-in
[sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html) module or
[pysqlite](https://github.com/ghaering/pysqlite).

## About APSW

[APSW](https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw/) stands for **Another Python
SQLite Wrapper** and was written by [Roger
Binns](http://www.rogerbinns.com/).

[APSW](https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw/) is a Python wrapper for the
[SQLite](http://sqlite.org/) embedded relational database engine. In
contrast to other wrappers such as
[pysqlite](https://github.com/ghaering/pysqlite) it focuses on
being a minimal layer over SQLite attempting just to translate the
complete SQLite API into Python.
